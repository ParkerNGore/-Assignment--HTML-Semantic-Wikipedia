    <h1>Computer Science</h1>
    <p>
      Computer science is the study of computation and information. Computer
      science deals with theory of computation, algorithms, computational
      problems and the design of computer systems hardware, software and
      applications. Computer science addresses both human-made and natural
      information processes, such as communication, control, perception,
      learning and intelligence especially in human-made computing systems and
      machines. According to Peter Denning, the fundamental question underlying
      computer science is, What can be (efficiently) automated? Its fields can
      be divided into theoretical and practical disciplines. Computational
      complexity theory is highly abstract, while computer graphics and
      computational geometry emphasizes real-world applications. Algorithmics is
      called the heart of computer science. Programming language theory
      considers approaches to the description of computational processes, while
      software engineering involves the use of programming languages and complex
      systems. Computer architecture and computer engineering deals with
      construction of computer components and computer-controlled equipment.
      Humanâ€“computer interaction considers the challenges in making computers
      useful, usable, and accessible. Artificial intelligence aims to synthesize
      goal-orientated processes such as problem-solving, decision-making,
      environmental adaptation, motion planning, learning, and communication
      found in humans and animals.

    <section id="History">
      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>
        The earliest foundations of what would become computer science predate
        the invention of the modern digital computer. Machines for calculating
        fixed numerical tasks such as the abacus have existed since antiquity,
        aiding in computations such as multiplication and division. Algorithms
        for performing computations have existed since antiquity, even before
        the development of sophisticated computing equipment. Wilhelm Schickard
        designed and constructed the first working mechanical calculator in
        1623. In 1673, Gottfried Leibniz demonstrated a digital mechanical
        calculator, called the Stepped Reckoner. He may be considered the first
        computer scientist and information theorist, for, among other reasons,
        documenting the binary number system. In 1820, Thomas de Colmar launched
        the mechanical calculator industry when he invented his simplified
        arithmometer, which was the first calculating machine strong enough and
        reliable enough to be used daily in an office environment. Charles
        Babbage started the design of the first automatic mechanical calculator,
        his Difference Engine, in 1822, which eventually gave him the idea of
        the first programmable mechanical calculator, his Analytical Engine. He
        started developing this machine in 1834, and "in less than two years, he
        had sketched out many of the salient features of the modern computer".
        "A crucial step was the adoption of a punched card system derived from
        the Jacquard loom" making it infinitely programmable. In 1843, during
        the translation of a French article on the Analytical Engine, Ada
        Lovelace wrote, in one of the many notes she included, an algorithm to
        compute the Bernoulli numbers, which is considered to be the first
        published algorithm ever specifically tailored for implementation on a
        computer. Around 1885, Herman Hollerith invented the tabulator, which
        used punched cards to process statistical information; eventually his
        company became part of IBM. Following Babbage, although unaware of his
        earlier work, Percy Ludgate in 1909 published the 2nd of the only two
        designs for mechanical analytical engines in history. In 1937, one
        hundred years after Babbage's impossible dream, Howard Aiken convinced
        IBM, which was making all kinds of punched card equipment and was also
        in the calculator business to develop his giant programmable calculator,
        the ASCC/Harvard Mark I, based on Babbage's Analytical Engine, which
        itself used cards and a central computing unit. When the machine was
        finished, some hailed it as "Babbage's dream come true".

    <section id="Etymology">
      <h2>Etymology</h2>
      <p>
        Although first proposed in 1956,[26] the term "computer science" appears
        in a 1959 article in Communications of the ACM,[40] in which Louis Fein
        argues for the creation of a Graduate School in Computer Sciences
        analogous to the creation of Harvard Business School in 1921,[41]
        justifying the name by arguing that, like management science, the
        subject is applied and interdisciplinary in nature, while having the
        characteristics typical of an academic discipline.[40] His efforts, and
        those of others such as numerical analyst George Forsythe, were
        rewarded: universities went on to create such departments, starting with
        Purdue in 1962.[42] Despite its name, a significant amount of computer
        science does not involve the study of computers themselves. Because of
        this, several alternative names have been proposed.[43] Certain
        departments of major universities prefer the term computing science, to
        emphasize precisely that difference. Danish scientist Peter Naur
        suggested the term datalogy,[44] to reflect the fact that the scientific
        discipline revolves around data and data treatment, while not
        necessarily involving computers. The first scientific institution to use
        the term was the Department of Datalogy at the University of Copenhagen,
        founded in 1969, with Peter Naur being the first professor in datalogy.
        The term is used mainly in the Scandinavian countries. An alternative
        term, also proposed by Naur, is data science; this is now used for a
        multi-disciplinary field of data analysis, including statistics and
        databases.

    <section id="Philosophy">
      <h2>Philosophy</h2>
      <p>
        A number of computer scientists have argued for the distinction of three
        separate paradigms in computer science. Peter Wegner argued that those
        paradigms are science, technology, and mathematics.[52] Peter Denning's
        working group argued that they are theory, abstraction (modeling), and
        design.[53] Amnon H. Eden described them as the "rationalist paradigm"
        (which treats computer science as a branch of mathematics, which is
        prevalent in theoretical computer science, and mainly employs deductive
        reasoning), the "technocratic paradigm" (which might be found in
        engineering approaches, most prominently in software engineering), and
        the "scientific paradigm" (which approaches computer-related artifacts
        from the empirical perspective of natural sciences, identifiable in some
        branches of artificial intelligence).[54] Computer science focuses on
        methods involved in design, specification, programming, verification,
        implementation and testing of human-made computing systems.[55]

    <section id="Fields">
      <h2>Fields</h2>
      <p>
        As a discipline, computer science spans a range of topics from
        theoretical studies of algorithms and the limits of computation to the
        practical issues of implementing computing systems in hardware and
        software.[56][57] CSAB, formerly called Computing Sciences Accreditation
        Boardâ€”which is made up of representatives of the Association for
        Computing Machinery (ACM), and the IEEE Computer Society (IEEE
        CS)[58]â€”identifies four areas that it considers crucial to the
        discipline of computer science: theory of computation, algorithms and
        data structures, programming methodology and languages, and computer
        elements and architecture. In addition to these four areas, CSAB also
        identifies fields such as software engineering, artificial intelligence,
        computer networking and communication, database systems, parallel
        computation, distributed computation, humanâ€“computer interaction,
        computer graphics, operating systems, and numerical and symbolic
        computation as being important areas of computer science.[56]

      <h3>Theoretical computer science</h3>
      <!-- Here I start to use other headers to clearly show sections or "subsections" -->
      <p>
        Theoretical Computer Science is mathematical and abstract in spirit, but
        it derives its motivation from the practical and everyday computation.
        Its aim is to understand the nature of computation and, as a consequence
        of this understanding, provide more efficient methodologies. All studies
        related to mathematical, logic and formal concepts and methods could be
        considered as theoretical computer science, provided that the motivation
        is clearly drawn from the field of computing.

      <h4>Data structures and algorithms</h4>
      <p>
        Data structures and algorithms are the studies of commonly used
        computational methods and their computational efficiency.

    <section id="Theory-of-computation">
      <h4>Theory of computation</h4>
      <p>
        According to Peter Denning, the fundamental question underlying computer
        science is, "What can be (efficiently) automated?"[5] Theory of
        computation is focused on answering fundamental questions about what can
        be computed and what amount of resources are required to perform those
        computations. In an effort to answer the first question, computability
        theory examines which computational problems are solvable on various
        theoretical models of computation. The second question is addressed by
        computational complexity theory, which studies the time and space costs
        associated with different approaches to solving a multitude of
        computational problems. The famous P = NP? problem, one of the
        Millennium Prize Problems,[59] is an open problem in the theory of
        computation.

    <section id="Information-and-coding-theory">
      <h4>Information and coding theory</h4>
      <p>
        nformation theory is related to the quantification of information. This
        was developed by Claude Shannon to find fundamental limits on signal
        processing operations such as compressing data and on reliably storing
        and communicating data.[60] Coding theory is the study of the properties
        of codes (systems for converting information from one form to another)
        and their fitness for a specific application. Codes are used for data
        compression, cryptography, error detection and correction, and more
        recently also for network coding. Codes are studied for the purpose of
        designing efficient and reliable data transmission methods. [61]

    <section id="Programming-language-theory">
      <h4>Programming language theory</h4>
      <p>
        Programming language theory is a branch of computer science that deals
        with the design, implementation, analysis, characterization, and
        classification of programming languages and their individual features.
        It falls within the discipline of computer science, both depending on
        and affecting mathematics, software engineering, and linguistics. It is
        an active research area, with numerous dedicated academic journals.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="Formal-methods">
      <h4>Formal methods</h4>
      <p>
        Formal methods are a particular kind of mathematically based technique
        for the specification, development and verification of software and
        hardware systems.[62] The use of formal methods for software and
        hardware design is motivated by the expectation that, as in other
        engineering disciplines, performing appropriate mathematical analysis
        can contribute to the reliability and robustness of a design. They form
        an important theoretical underpinning for software engineering,
        especially where safety or security is involved. Formal methods are a
        useful adjunct to software testing since they help avoid errors and can
        also give a framework for testing. For industrial use, tool support is
        required. However, the high cost of using formal methods means that they
        are usually only used in the development of high-integrity and
        life-critical systems, where safety or security is of utmost importance.
        Formal methods are best described as the application of a fairly broad
        variety of theoretical computer science fundamentals, in particular
        logic calculi, formal languages, automata theory, and program semantics,
        but also type systems and algebraic data types to problems in software
        and hardware specification and verification.
